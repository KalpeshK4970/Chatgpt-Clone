# ChatgptClone
I have built a chatbot using OpenAI API and Gradio. The chatbot is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained 
Transformer) language model, which can generate human-like text based on a given prompt. The code 
uses Gradio to create a web interface for the chatbot. It defines a text box for entering messages, a 
chatbot interface for displaying the conversation, and a button for submitting the message.
